# Class assignment

## Background
You have been hired by a meteorological organization to build an application to analyze and report upon weather data. During this course you will be building that application.

## Overview of application
1. You will be using real meteorological data
1. First step will be to develop tests to verify you have loaded the data correctly.
1. Second, you will build routines to log any issues with the data.
1. Next, the data will be loaded into a relational database.
1. With the data loaded, it will be time to produce some analyses of that data.
1. Having analyzed the data we will look at alternative ways that it can be stored, and redesign the application to use those.
1. Given the volume of the data you will need to understand the performance characteristics of all your code using measurement.
1. Then, you will use measurement results to develop code that will enhance the application performance.
With a performant application, you will then apply advanced Python techniques to enhance the application.
1. Finally, you will build a REST API to your application.
